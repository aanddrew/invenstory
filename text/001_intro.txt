Ivan:
Hey Kid, wake up you're at the bottom of the mountain. 
I heard there's a pretty bad guy at the top.

Tori:
Who are you? Why am I here?

Ivan:
Excellent open ended questions! Now I can begin the exposition of this story.
Listen, I'm gonna be honest they gave me a script but this is actually a video
game. I don't know what's going on here and you don't either.

Tori:
So I'm not real? Who would create such a sick environment?

Ivan:
Relax orwell we haven't even gotten to the game part LOL! You're behind a
screen right now don't get so serious xD.

Tori:
Right. Wait, what do you mean I'm behind a screen.

Ivan:
Just ignore that, you have a goal to reach the top of the mountain to defeat the
bad guy (TM). Stop asking questions, time is of the essence!

Tori:
Why is the bad guy trademarked?

Ivan:
You don't really get this whole "stop asking questions" part do you?

Tori:

Ivan:

(Pause)

Tori:

Ivan:
NO QUESTION MARKS!!!!!!!
